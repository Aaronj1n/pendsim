# pendsim: an Inverted Pendulum-On-A-Cart Sandbox!
Created by Mike Sutherland with the EASEL group at UC Irvine.
For documentation, see: http://rland93.github.io/pendsim/

*pendsim* is a Python package that can be used to help 
students design, analyze, and visualize virtual 
experiments for an inverted pendulum on a cart with 
feedback control. Example notebooks cover topics 
ranging from linearization to state estimation and 
optimal control for this classical nonlinear system.
