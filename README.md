pendsim is a Python package that can be used to help 
students design, analyze, and visualize virtual 
experiments for an inverted pendulum on a cart with 
feedback control. Example notebooks cover topics 
ranging from linearization to state estimation and 
optimal control for this classical nonlinear system.
