    "# Swing Up of Pendulum From Resting Position With Energy Control\n",
    "\n",
    "It's quite alright if the pendulum starts from an upright position. We can stabilize it with simple controllers, even as simple as Bang-Bang (On-Off) control. But what about when it is in the downward position? We will need a controller that can guide the pendulum from the lower position, completely through the non-linear region (near $\\theta=\\pm \\pi/2$), and to the upward position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any simple (linear) controller will fail to guide us through this non-linear region. So what do we do? Fortunately, we have an option: swing up by energy control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The swing-up strategy exploits that the potential energy of the system is a good proxy of the state. Namely, that the maximum energy point is also the desired point for the controller: at $\\theta=0$, the small mass $m$ is as high as it could possibly be. At $\\theta=\\pi$, the energy is at a minimum. And the position of the large mass has no effect on the potential energy of the system, because the cart is always on level ground. A successful swing-up strategy will pump energy into the system to maximize the potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions which map the system state to a scalar, and which serve as a good proxy for the success or failure of a the state, are Lyapunov functions. A increase (or decrease) in a Lyapunov function must always result in driving the system towards a goal state. With these properties, so long as the Lyapunov function increases (or decreases), the state will be driven towards the goal. A control strategy can then be derived from the derivative of the Lyapunov function, with the control input driving the Lyapunov function in the desired direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the energy of the system under control is a good starting point for deriving a Lyapunov function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we use the following as the Lyapunov function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V = \\frac{(E-E_0)^2}{2} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging potential energy terms and differentiating yields the control strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "u = k (E - E_0) \\dot{\\theta} \\cos{\\theta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can see is a function of the energy loss, the angular velocity, and the pendulum position. In particular, when $\\theta=\\pi/2$ or $\\theta=-\\pi/2$, no amount of sideways push will change the pendulum angle. When $\\theta=\\pi$ or $\\theta=0$, a sideways push affects the pendulum angle the most. This behavior is captured by the $\\cos{\\theta}$ term. This term is then scaled by $\\dot{\\theta}$; when $\\dot{\\theta}$ is positive, the control action pushes left; when $\\dot{\\theta}$ is negative, the control action pushes right. Finally, the amount of push is scaled by the energy of the system; when $E=E_0$, the action is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation of this strategy and particular details can be found in Astrom's [Swinging up a Pendulum by Energy Control](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109899001405). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the actual strategy, rather than using an arbitrary gain $k$, we use a coefficient $n$ times the gravity $g$ as the gain. "
