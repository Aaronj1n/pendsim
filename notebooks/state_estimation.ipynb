    "# State Estimation with Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)\n",
    "All feedback control relies on measurements of the system state to inform the control actuation. This makes an accurate measurement or an estimation of the system state a very important factor in feedback control system performance. Here, we look at the Unscented Kalman Filter as a state estimator, and evaluate how a PID controller with accurate state estimation compares to the performance of one that does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "State estimation is the problem of estimating the true system state from noisy, incomplete, or lower-dimensional sensor inputs. A commonly used state estimator is the Kalman Filter. Here, we will use the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to estimate the state, and see the impact that improved state estimation has on control outcomes, in comparison to simply using the noisy states as they are measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we do have measurements for every dimension of the state, and we also have measurements at every feedback control step. However, the measurements we do have are noisy. So we are using UKF here to improve the *state feedback* outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use an Unscented Kalman Filter over an Extended or standard Kalman Filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, we have a non-linear system. Because a simple Kalman Filter assumes linearity in system dynamics, it's likely that it will diverge, because the evolution of the pendulum system cannot be modeled linearly. An Extended Kalman Filter would improve this somewhat; it propagates the distribution of the inputs through a first-order linerization of the non-linear system. But, a first order linear approximation is just that: an approximation. This leads us to the UKF; in the UKF, a carefully chosen set of sample points is propagated through the *true* (non-linear!) system, which results in an improved estimation outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an estimate would not see errors inherent to treating of the system as linear (as in the Kalman Filter case) or errors arising from dropping higher-order terms from linearized system at each state (as in the Extended Kalman Filter case).\n",
    "\n",
    "With full state feedback, this filter will diverge only in the presence of un-modeled dynamics (external forces) or noise that is non-gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the Unscented Kalman Filter, see https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/unscented.pdf. This module (and the UKF augmented controllers within) uses the wonderful python package `filterpy`, which has a companion [textbook](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/) that covers filtering in detail."
